Was unable to ever compile my code with the make file properly, and honestly spent way to long trying 
to create weird code to get it to compile.

Theoretically, based on traces, all code should be functional as the logic is based 
directly on the previous project, with the exception of the readfile function possibly not working. 

Additionally, the debug mode is not setup correctly since I could not get it to compile at all :(
