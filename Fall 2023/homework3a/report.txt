The most interesting thing I noticed when tracing the code and converting the hex into decimal, was that the houses weren't
necessarily in order. argc and argv already start off by going (all decimal preceded by 140722338749---)148, then 136 respectively.
While then num1 and num2 would jump to the 60s and increase: 160, then 164 respectively. Similar patterns would occur in the 
rest of the trace; where once the varible type changed, the house kind of jumped forwards and/or backwards.
