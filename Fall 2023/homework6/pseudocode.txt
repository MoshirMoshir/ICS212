deleteRecord

- start: The pointer to the first record of the list (or NULL)
- uaccountno: The user's account number (integer)

Structure definition:
struct record
{
    int               accountno;
    char              name[30];
    char              address[50];
    struct record*    next;
};
-----------------------------------
define a pointer to record called temp
allocate a heap space and store its address into temp

define a int called out
copy from -1 to out

copy from start to next in the record whose address is in temp

while( accountno in the record whose address is in next in the record whose address is in temp is not equal to uaccountno && next in the record whose address is in temp is not equal to NULL )
    copy from next in the record whose address is in temp to temp

if (accountno in the record whose address is in next in the record whose address is in temp is equal to uaccountno)
    copy from next in the record whose address is in next in the record whose address is in temp to next in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from 0 to out


return out
