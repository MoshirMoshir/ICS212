addRecord

*** Assume the following variables are already defined. ***

- start: The pointer to the first record of the list (or NULL)
- uaccountno: The user's account number (integer)
- uname: a character array containing the user's name
- uaddress: a character array containing the user's address

Structure definition:
struct record
{
    int               accountno;
    char              name[30];
    char              address[50];
    struct record*    next;
};
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

define a pointer to record called temp
allocate a heap space and store its address into temp

if( start is equal to NULL )
{ 
    copy from uaccountno to accountno in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from uname to name in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from uaddress to address in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from NULL to next in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from temp to start
}
else
{
    copy from start to temp
    while (accountno in the record whose address is in temp is greater than uaccountno || next in the record whose address is in temp is equal to NULL)
    {
        copy from next in the record whose address is in temp to temp
    }
    copy from temp to next in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from accountno in the record whose address is in temp to accountno in the record whose address is in next in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from name in the record whose address is in temp to name in the record whose address is in next in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from address in the record whose address is in temp to address in the record whose address is in next in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from uaccountno to accountno in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from uname to name in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from uaddress to address in the record whose address is in temp
