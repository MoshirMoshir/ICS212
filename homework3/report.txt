I think the most interesting thing I noticed was how the address don't seem to be going in order from a smaller number to a greater number;
from the first 0x7ffea5bd14bc to 0x7ffea5bd14b0 alone it already is going to a "smaller" numbered address. It does seem if the type is the same,
it will go from smaller to greater, but whenever it changes types, it will seemingly go to a random address close by (though there does seem to be
a possible pattern to it)
