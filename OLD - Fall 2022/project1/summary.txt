The majority of the code functions as intended though there are a few bugs that still need to be fixed;

I was unable to properly fix the read function as on the original homework I was unable to complete it correctly and
in this project I found it to work extremely inconsistently. Additionally, in my process to attempt to fix it, I managed to break my
delete function, thus I was also unable to fix that since I most likely changed a piece of code somewhere that breaks the delete
function while trying the fix the read function. I do know the write function works as intended as if there is only 1 address,
the program is able to successfully read and write it, and the database_data gets written correctly. Somewhere my read function is rereading the file 
causing for the address to duplicate and shift. I was unable to pinpoint the code that was causing this issue 
and I was afraid of breaking anything else after I bricked my working delete function.

Multiple Address lines do work, though there is an additional bug that sometimes puts the last few lines of a previous Address into the 
next record's Address.

All error and debug messages correctly displays if it occurs.

All other functions properly and correctly executes when called.

The program is able to run, but is unable to be fully utilized due to 2 broken functions.
